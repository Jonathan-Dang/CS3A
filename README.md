# CS3A
All the code from my CS3A class from PCC
This code was produced using Qt so you will see .pro files within the solutions, do not mind these files as they were automatically created.
I uploaded these files to have a portfolio of solutions to display my proficiency with the coding language.
I will not take responsibility if my code is used in a malicious way or does not conform to any school guidelines.
I do not condone plagurism of any kind and promote a healthy learning environment.
